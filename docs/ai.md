Prompt-1

You are coding inside an existing Node.js + Express backend project with PostgreSQL using the pg Pool library.

Task: Implement a secure user registration feature with the following requirements:

Validation

Use Zod to validate incoming request body (username, password).

Return an appropriate error response if validation fails.

Password Security

Hash passwords using bcrypt with a secure salt.

Database

Use the pg Pool to insert the user into the users table.

Release DB clients properly after queries.

Prevent duplicate usernames — if attempted, return a meaningful error without crashing.

Architecture

Create src/modules/auth/auth.service.js with:

async function registerUser(username, password) — handles validation, hashing, DB insert, and returns created user data.

Create src/modules/auth/auth.controller.js with:

async function register(req, res, next) — reads from req.body, calls registerUser, sends { message, data } with HTTP 201 on success.

Uses try/catch and next(err) for error handling.

Testing

Create src/tests/auth.test.js with a Supertest-based example that:

Sends a POST request to /auth/register.

Checks for 201 status and correct response structure.

Implementation Details

Use async/await everywhere.

Follow clean code practices and proper error handling.

Do not modify unrelated files.

Ensure all new files are properly imported/exported where needed.

Context

We need a secure register endpoint that:

Validates input using Zod

Hashes passwords using bcrypt

Inserts the user into PostgreSQL via pg Pool

Returns { message, data } with HTTP 201 on success

Gracefully handles duplicate usernames

Organizes logic into auth.service.js and auth.controller.js

Uses async/await, try/catch, and proper DB client release

Includes a Supertest example for automated testing

Changes Applied

auth.service.js → Added registerUser(username, password) to handle validation, hashing, and DB insert

auth.controller.js → Added register(req, res, next) to call service, send { message, data }, and use next(err) for errors

Error Handling → Added duplicate username handling without crashing the server

Testing → Added src/tests/auth.test.js with Supertest to test /auth/register endpoint

Best Practices → Used async/await, proper error handling, and clean code structure throughout


Context:
We are implementing the subscriptions module in SubSentry. Requirements:

Zod schema for create/update:

{
  service_name: string,
  category: string,
  cost: number >= 0,
  billing_cycle: enum('Monthly','Quarterly','Yearly'),
  auto_renews: boolean,
  start_date: string (ISO)
}


Annualized cost calculation in service layer:

Monthly → cost × 12

Quarterly → cost × 4

Yearly → cost

CRUD Endpoints (all protected via JWT auth):

POST /api/subscriptions → creates subscription, stores annualized_cost, returns full object

PUT /api/subscriptions/:id → updates subscription, recalculates annualized_cost

DELETE /api/subscriptions/:id → removes subscription

Listing Endpoint:

GET /api/subscriptions with query params:

page, limit (pagination with sane caps, e.g., 5–50)

category, billingCycle (filters)

search (case-insensitive ILIKE on service_name)

sortBy (safe format: field_order, e.g. annualizedCost_desc)

Return: { items, page, limit, total, totalPages }

Follow existing repo/service/controller pattern of the project.

Ensure safe parameterized SQL with pg (no string concatenation).

Exclude test scaffolding (no Jest/Supertest).

Prompt:
“Implement the full subscriptions module in our Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL project with Zod validation, repo/service/controller structure, and JWT-protected routes.

Define a Zod schema for create/update with required fields.

Add an annualized cost calculator in the service layer.

Implement CRUD routes (POST, PUT, DELETE) storing/recomputing annualized_cost.

Add listing route (GET /api/subscriptions) supporting pagination, filters (category, billing_cycle), case-insensitive search (ILIKE on service_name), and safe sorting (safelist fields including annualized_cost).

Use CTE for total count in pagination.

Cap limit between 5–50.

Follow the existing repo/service pattern of the project.

Do not generate any tests.”

Changes Applied:

Added Zod schema for subscriptions create/update DTO.

Implemented annualized cost computation in service layer.

Added CRUD endpoints for subscriptions with recalculated annualized cost.

Created listing endpoint with pagination, filters, case-insensitive search, and safelisted sort fields.

Adopted CTE-based total count for efficient pagination.

Enforced limit capping (5–50) to prevent abuse.

All routes integrated with existing JWT auth middleware and follow current project structure.
